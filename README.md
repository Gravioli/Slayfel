# [This is Slayfel](https://wiseoldman.net/players/slayfel)

Slayfel is my Slayer only Old School Runescape account.

He is locked to only being able to play through the game using the Slayer skill, meaning all gear, resources, other skills can only be gathered or trained using the drops from Slayer tasks. There are a few exceptions so it's worth taking a look through [the rules](https://github.com/Gravioli/Slayfel/wiki) page in the wiki to see what's what.
